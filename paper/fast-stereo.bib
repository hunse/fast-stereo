@article{Abrams1989,
abstract = {Dynamic characteristics observed in the trajectories of saccadic eye movements reveal systematic variability of the force pulses used to move the eyes. This variability causes saccades to exhibit a linear speed-accuracy trade-off: As the average distance and duration of saccades toward specified target points increase, the standard deviations of saccadic-movement endpoints increase linearly with the saccades' average velocity. The linear trade-off, and other observed stochastic properties of saccades, may be attributed to noise in neuromotor processes and may be described in terms of an impulse-variability model originally designed for characterizing limb movements. According to the model, both eye and limb movements are controlled through stochastic force and time parameters that govern movement kinematics. Such an account may promote a unified conceptual framework for understanding a wide range of motor behavior.},

@inproceedings{Clark1998,
abstract = {An important aspect of computer-controlled camera motion systems is that of the generation of saccadic movements, which shift the camera gaze quickly from one fixation position to another. Recent psychophysical experiments suggest that there exists a causal connection between spatial shifts in visual attention and the production of saccadic eye movements in humans. Motivated by this experimental evidence, we propose a winner-take-all based model of exogenous spatial attention, involving both sustained and transient feature detection channels, and link it to the targetting and triggering of saccadic eye movements. We show that this model accounts for a range of oculomotor phenomena observed in human subjects. We describe the application of this model to a robotic camera gaze control system},

@article{Johansson2001,
abstract = {We analyzed the coordination between gaze behavior, fingertip movements, and movements of the manipulated object when subjects reached for and grasped a bar and moved it to press a target-switch. Subjects almost exclusively fixated certain landmarks critical for the control of the task. Landmarks at which contact events took place were obligatory gaze targets. These included the grasp site on the bar, the target, and the support surface where the bar was returned after target contact. Any obstacle in the direct movement path and the tip of the bar were optional landmarks. Subjects never fixated the hand or the moving bar. Gaze and hand/bar movements were linked concerning landmarks, with gaze leading. The instant that gaze exited a given landmark coincided with a kinematic event at that landmark in a manner suggesting that subjects monitored critical kinematic events for phasic verification of task progress and subgoal completion. For both the obstacle and target, subjects directed saccades and fixations to sites that were offset from the physical extension of the objects. Fixations related to an obstacle appeared to specify a location around which the extending tip of the bar should travel. We conclude that gaze supports hand movement planning by marking key positions to which the fingertips or grasped object are subsequently directed. The salience of gaze targets arises from the functional sensorimotor requirements of the task. We further suggest that gaze control contributes to the development and maintenance of sensorimotor correlation matrices that support predictive motor control in manipulation.},

@article{Rayner2010,
abstract = {The perceptual span or region of effective vision during eye fixations in reading was examined as a function of reading speed (fast readers were compared with slow readers), font characteristics (fixed width vs. proportional width), and intraword spacing (normal or reduced). The main findings were that fast readers (reading at about 330 wpm) had a larger perceptual span than did slow readers (reading about 200 wpm) and that the span was not affected by whether or not the text was fixed width or proportional width. In addition, there were interesting font and intraword spacing effects that have important implications for the optimal use of space in a line of text.},
