\opening{Dear Dr. Gini,} % eg Hello.


Please consider the attached manuscript entitled ``Task-Driven Resource Allocation for Real-Time Stereo with Belief Propagation'' for publication as a research paper in the journal Robotics and Autonomous Systems.

Highlights:

\begin{itemize}
\item Stereo depth can be achieved at frame rates without specialized hardware
\item More computational resources are spent on the most important parts of the scene
\item Fovea placement is determined by task and by scene content (eg. objects)
\item multi-resolution belief propagation
\item evaluated on KITTI Vision Benchmark
\end{itemize}



\noindent
Sincerely,


\noindent
Jeff Orchard
